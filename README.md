# Tasks

- Narration Text responding to user actions.
- AI "portal" that allows user to ask anything about me.
- create invisible subgroups for each console section that scales up the entire group on hover.
  - add this back in, but do not scale up buttons on hover, instead just highlight them.
- Add a togglable dark mode icon and make it functional.
- turn the narration panel into a floating panel, with a small arrow (maybe with 3d rotation)
- portfolio: identify sections:
  - portfolio pieces + background info + coding principles/values + open-source contribution
  - multi-selection menu that makes each one visible from the start...gooey nav could be a good one, with different URL routing paths.
- Enhance the clipboard text copied icon to be an animation with a colored, green check.
- Switch up the background colors.

# Bugs

- Fix mobile layout for console buttons.
- Fix text clipping from text being too large on all smaller layouts.
